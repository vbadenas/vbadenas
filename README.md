# Hi there, I'm Victor Badenas 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a framework for training models with pytorch called [frarch](https://github.com/vbadenas/frarch) along with my master thesis at HPAI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning and Machine Learning @Fib-UPC.
- 🤔 In 2022 I hope to improve upon the repositories [DNNEffects](https://github.com/vbadenas/DNNEffects) & [frarch](https://github.com/vbadenas/frarch) to train models for emulating audio effects using DNNs.
- 💬 Ask me about deep learning, music and sound 😊🎵🔊📖
